<h1>💀 MALIGA, THE MUSE OF TRAUMA – Project 9 of The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

<h2>📖 Overview</h2>

<h3>📌Situation</h3>
<p>I've enjoyed writing fiction since high school, and one of the biggest challenges for me and for many other writers is creating a character who truly feels interesting and deep, with clear goals, fears, and inner conflicts. Someone the reader actually wants to follow. When we hit a creative block, it feels like the muses have abandoned us."</p>

<h3>🎯 Task</h3>
<p>My task was to create a simple program to practice generating text files. The program guides the user through a series of questions and answers to create a complete character. In the end, a text file is generated containing the character that was created.</p>

<h3>⚙️ Action</h3>
<p>I designed a ritual mechanic where players input a string of runes. A function compares it to the true name of power. If the spell is incorrect, we handle the error.</p>

<h3>🧠 Result</h3>
<p>The result is a suspenseful and interactive mini-game that blends programming logic with horror storytelling. <strong>Eldritch Runes</strong> turns basic error handling into a dramatic experience, showing how even fundamental concepts can be wrapped in thematic, memorable ways.</p>

<h2>🌐 Multi-Language Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>Just like the first project, this one is being developed in Python, JavaScript, and C++. I’m studying these three languages simultaneously to avoid becoming too attached to the quirks of just one. This method helps me grasp the core logic of programming — which is universal across languages — rather than memorizing syntax. By rewriting the same project in multiple languages, I reinforce my understanding of structures, variables, functions, and flow — while also appreciating the expressive power of each language.</p>

<h2>🧪 Project Scope: Eldritch Runes</h2>
<p>Core concepts covered (in addition to concepts from previous projects):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Errors and exceptions</li>
</ul>

<h1>🃏 About the Code Fool's Journey</h1>
<p>The Fool's Journey is similar to Joseph Campbell’s famous Hero’s Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22 stages, based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal power, just like programmers and artists. Here, each project increases in complexity and covered concepts, from simple variables and data types to APIs, Memory Management, Databases and GUI.</p>
