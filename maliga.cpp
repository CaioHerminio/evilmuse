    std::cout << "Let's enjoy destroying someone's life and drink the tears of our readers!\n";

    std::cout << "\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves, darling. Evil is a delicate art.\n";
    std::cout << "Start by telling me the name of the character we will destroy: ";

    std::cout << "\nBeautiful. Now, the fun begins! What is the traumatic event that happened to " << name << "?\n";
    std::cout << "Something that hurt them really, really deep and changed their life forever: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, trauma);

    std::cout << "\nMuahaha. Deliciously sad. I would hate to be in their place.\n";
    std::cout << "Now we have everything we need to make this character come to life, darling student.\n";
    std::cout << "Before this day ends, you will understand why I'm not just the most sexy, smart and cute muse, but the most capable.\n";

    std::cout << "\nThis traumatic event will change the character, giving them a weakness and a strength.\n";
    std::cout << "Example: Bruce Wayne lost his parents and became independent but also deeply lonely.\n";
    std::cout << "What is the strength that your character received thanks to this trauma? This strength will help them on their journey: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, strength);

    std::cout << "\nNow, the best part, what is the weakness that the trauma gave them?\n";
    std::cout << "This weakness will hinder them on their journey: ";

    std::cout << "\nNow, my dear apprentice of evil, let's move on to a more advanced part.\n";
    std::cout << "Maslow's pyramid - What is the area that the trauma has damaged in the character? (e.g., safety, love/belonging, esteem, self-actualization): ";

    std::cout << "\nThis is what your character really wants, unconsciously.\n";
    std::cout << "What is the GOAL your character thinks will satisfy their need? It must be the wrong method: ";

    std::cout << "\nNow, it's time to destroy them.\n";
    std::cout << "This is the most important moment in your characterâ€™s arc, the moment that breaks them.\n";
    std::cout << "What will happen when the character finally loses their GOAL, is defeated, humiliated?\n";
    std::cout << "Picture it: they invested everything, every emotion, every breath, into chasing something they believed would make them whole.\n";
    std::cout << "And yet... it was the wrong thing all along. The goal fails. They fail. And they fall â€” to the bottom of the well.\n";
    std::cout << "This is their spiritual death. A moment of absolute hopelessness. No more illusions. No more plans.\n";
    std::cout << "But within this darkness, a spark: the epiphany. Inside this 'cave of death', they may discover the truth.\n";
    std::cout << "The GOAL was never the real solution. The NEED â€” the true wound â€” is something deeper.\n";
    std::cout << "And now, they are faced with a choice: grow and rise anew... or fall into an even deeper layer of self-deception.\n";
    std::cout << "We wonâ€™t craft every nuance right now. Just sketch out what this moment of DEATH and possible RESURRECTION might look like.\n";
    std::getline(std::cin, resurrection);

    std::cout << "\nNow, the last part.\n";
    std::cout << "Create the final status quo of the character, who they become at the end of the story: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, final_status);

    std::cout << "\nVery good, my dear student.\n";
    std::cout << "You have learned exactly how to use the power of a terrible trauma to create a character.\n";
    std::cout << "Your character has a past, a future, an internal conflict, an external conflict, and an arc of transformation.\n";
